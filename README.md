# neural-network-challenge-2

**Branched neural network model created to determing whether or not employees are likely to leave, and/or move to another department, based on the dataset.**

**Two feature categories were 'attrition' and 'department'.  StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, were used to transform the training and testing data.  Activations used: 'Softmax' for 'department_output' and 'Sigmoid' for 'attrition_output.**
